## :lang pseudo-class
The content of HTML documents can be in many different languages. To specify the primary language of a document, we use the lang attribute on the root element

`<html lang="en>`

We can also use the lang attribute within the page to demarcate specific elements or sections that are in a different language to the documentâ€™s primary language.

`<html lang="en">
<head></head>
<body>
    <section lang="fr">
        <p>Comment dites-vous "Bonjour" en Espanol?</p>
    </section>
</body>
</html>`
