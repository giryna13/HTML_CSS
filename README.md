# Pseudo-classes:

## :lang pseudo-class
The content of HTML documents can be in many different languages. To specify the primary language of a document, we use the lang attribute on the root element

`<html lang="en>`

We can also use the lang attribute within the page to demarcate specific elements or sections that are in a different language to the documentâ€™s primary language.

If we wanted to style these sections of the page differently, we could use the [lang] attribute selector to select all elements, or children of elements, with the specific language attribute.
